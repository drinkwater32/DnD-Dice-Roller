# DnD-Dice-Roller
My first full stack learning project! Figured I'd start with a basic application to help with dice rolling for a DnD campaign, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the front and while using Python for the back end

Extremely basic application that allows you to roll a selected DnD dice with a standard roll, advantage, or disadvantage. 

To use-- clone the repo, activate python virtual environment, then run python app.py and navigate to the development link in your local browser.
